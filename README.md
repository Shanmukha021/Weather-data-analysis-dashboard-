# weather data analysis dashboard 
## Project Objective:
To build an interactive dashboard that analyzes weather data to provide insights on temperature, wind speed, and their relationships.

## Dataset Used    
The dataset used is a weather forecast dataset containing columns like wind speed, wind direction (degree), temperature, and more.

## Questions (KPIs):    
How does wind speed impact temperature?  What are the distribution patterns of wind speed and temperature?                  What trends can be identified for specific wind degrees?
## Process:      
Data is cleaned and processed, followed by the creation of interactive plots using Dash and Plotly for real-time data visualization and analysis.

## Dashboard:     
The dashboard includes multiple charts such as area plots, scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, box plots, and violin plots to explore weather data dynamically.

## Project Insights:       
Key insights include identifying relationships between wind speed and temperature, spotting distribution trends, and providing a clearer understanding of weather patterns for better decision-making.
